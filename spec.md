### Introduction

This specification outlines the structure and requirements for enabling
additional service discovery through profile definitions within a Decentralized
Identifier (DID) document. By integrating service endpoints and profile
information, this approach enhances the capabilities of DIDs for decentralized
and self-sovereign identity systems. Some of the possible advantages include: 

- service and profile crawlers become possible, enabling better service
discovery and interoperability across services. 
- better descriptive power for individual services composibility of capabilities for succinct representation of capabilities.

### Overview

A service profile is a pointer within a DID Document to a _resuable_ static
document resolvable by HTTP that describes the capabilities of a service.

  class Service {
      url: string
      profile: string
      integrity: string 
  }
  class DIDDocument {
    services: Service[]
  }
  class ServiceProfileMetadata {
      id: string
      profileType: string
      created: string
      description: string
      short_description: string
      docs_url: string
      version: string
      tags: string[]
  }
  class Proof {
    type: string 
    created: string
    proofValue: string
    verificationMethod: string
  }
  class ServiceProfile {
      metadata: Metadata
      proof: Proof
  }
  ServiceProfileMetadata "1" ..|> "1" ServiceProfile : contains
  Proof "1" ..|> "1" ServiceProfile : contains
  DIDDocument "1" .. "many" Service : contains
  DIDDocument "many" ..|> "1" ServiceProfile :  points to
```

### Objective

The purpose of this specification is to enhance the ability for an endpoint
system and user to discover capabilities of a service within a decentralized
context. Developed initially within the Trust Registry Task Force at Trust Over
IP to enable better protocol discovery, this spec offers a straightforward yet
effective discovery layer for both legacy and new trust registry services. The
intended audience includes individuals or entities seeking to improve service
interoperability with their existing services or on new services.

### Problem Statement

Current endpoint systems lack a clear method to identify the protocols a service
supports. The DID Core Specâ€™s Service Endpoint type field is not sufficiently
expressive for endpoints to fully understand what protocols a service endpoint
supports. This specification addresses this gap in the DID Core specification by
introducing a straightforward way for endpoints to indicate support of a
protocol or service using a structured Profile Document Model. These documents
are reusable, decentralized, and expressive documents that allow service
providers to connect and interoperate with endpoint systems with less friction.

### Example

In this example, we illustrate a practical example of profiles. We have a
Service that complies with the Trust Registry Protocol v2 specification
developed by Trust Over IP. This Service exposes an endpoint capable of
accommodating multiple profiles. When sharing the Service's DID Document, we
also share a Profile object with the endpoint, indicating its support for the
Trust Registry Protocol v2 Profile. The client now knows what the service
endpoint described supports, and how to interact with that service.

### Service Endpoint Profile Specification

_this section is normative_

The data structure outlined in this specification is designed to establish a
consistent approach for integrating service endpoint profiles within a DID
document. Adherence to the subsequent guidelines is mandatory:

- It is imperative that this structure takes the form of a singular struct.
- The ensuing properties are obligatory:
  - `uri`: A URI attribute delineating the interaction's endpoint address.
  - A choice between the ensuing options:
    - `profile`: A JSON Profile document that can be resolved through HTTPS. Further requisites are detailed in the "Profile Document" section.
    - `definition`: If provided, this signifies the resolvable URI attribute
      enmeshed within the DID document. The corresponding definition is required to comply with the specifications delineated in the subsequent profile document section.
    - An `integrity` property MAY be added as an aid in integrity protection and verification of the Profile document. It MUST be in the format of a  MultiHash, `<hash-func-type><digest-length><digest-value>` encoded as a varint and defined here [Multiformat](https://multiformats.io/multihash/). 

An array of structs is not valid.

**Example**

This following is an portion from the DID Document. 

```json
{
  "@context":[
      "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
      "https://trustoverip.org/profile/v2"
  ],
  ...
  "service": [{
    "id": "did:example:123#trust-registry",
    "type": "TrustRegistry", 
    "serviceEndpoint": {
        "profile": "https://trustoverip.org/profiles/trp/v2",
        "uri": "https://my-tr-service/",
        "integrity: "122041dd7b6443542e75701aa98a0c235951a28a0d851b11564d20022ab11d2589a8",
    }
  }]
}
```

### Profile Document Specification

#### Profile Data Model

_this section is normative_

The profile data model is heavily inspired by the VC Data Model.

In this section, we delve into the intricacies of the profile data payload
structure, designed to encapsulate essential information within a decentralized
context. The structured data adheres to a comprehensive schema, ensuring
consistency and coherence in the representation of profiles associated with
Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). By adhering to this structure, service
endpoint profiles can integrate with DID documents, fostering
enhanced service discovery and interaction.

The profile data payload is composed of three primary components, each serving a distinct purpose:

**Metadata:** This segment provides overarching details about the profile, offering
insight into its origins, content, and context. Key attributes encompass the
decentralized identifier (DID), profile type, creation timestamp, media type,
version, and descriptive elements that collectively contribute to the profile's
identity and purpose.

**Proof:** This component encapsulates information related to the authentication and integrity verification of the profile data. Various properties, including the proof type, creation timestamp, proof value, and verification method, work in
concert to substantiate the authenticity of the profile's content and source.

Throughout this section, we dissect the schema-driven structure of the profile
data payload, elucidating its constituent elements and their roles in enabling
robust, secure, and standardized profile integration within the realm of
Decentralized Identifiers. By comprehending the nuances of this payload format,
stakeholders can harness the power of interoperable profiles to facilitate
seamless interactions and enriched service discovery experiences.

```

#### Profile Data Model Specification 

A profile data model is a document with the following properties:

* The document **MUST** have a `metadata` object with the following properties:
    * The `id` property **MUST** be present. It must represent a unique indentifier within a governance framework.
    * The `owner` property **MAY** be present. It **MUST** represent a DID of the owner of the document if present. 
    * The document **MUST** have a `type` property and the the value of the `type` property **MUST** be, or map to (through interpretation of the @context property), one or more URIs. If more than one URI is provided, the URIs MUST be interpreted as an unordered set. It is RECOMMENDED that each URI in the type be one which, if dereferenced, results in a document containing machine-readable information about the type.
    * The document **MUST** contain a `profileType` property. If present, is a string indicating the specific type or category of the profile. This property can help categorize and classify the profile data further.
    * The document MAY contain a `created` property, which is an ISO-8601 timestamp indicating the date and time when the profile data was created or initially recorded.
    * The document MAY contain a `name` property, if provided, is a human-readable name assigned to the profile. It offers a recognizable label for the profile data.
    * The document MAY contain a `description` property. if given, offers a detailed textual description of the profile. This description can provide insights into the purpose, content, and usage of the profile data.
    * The document MAY contain a `short_description` property. If available, provides a succinct summary or brief overview of the profile. This summary can be useful for quick references.
    * The document MAY contain a `docs_url` property, if supplied, is a URL pointing to documentation related to the profile data. This URL can lead to additional resources or information about the profile.
    * The document MAY contain a `version` property. If given, holds a string indicating the version of the profile data. This version should follow the semantic versioning (semver) format for version numbering.
    * The document MAY contain a `tags` property. If present, is an array of strings that serve as tags associated with the profile data. These tags can aid in searchability and categorization of the profile. This is useful for indexers. 
      
#### JSON Schema

The Profile Document provides a comprehensive framework for capturing profile-related information within the DID document.

### Security Considerations

This section describe a non-normative, non-exhaustive list of security considerations. 

#### Cryptography Suites and Libraries
_This section is non-normative._

Some aspects of the profile model described in this specification can be protected through the use of cryptography. It is important for implementers to understand the cryptography suites and libraries used to create and process credentials and presentations. Implementing and auditing cryptography systems generally requires substantial experience. Effective red teaming can also help remove bias from security reviews.

#### Unsigned Profile Documents

_This section is non-normative._

This specification allows profiles to be produced that do not contain signatures or proofs of any kind. These types of profiles are often useful for cases where users may not have the ability to take advantage of the cryptographic proof mechanisms. Endpoint systems should be aware that these types of profiles are not verifiable because the authorship either is not known or cannot be trusted.

### Future Work

**Service Descriptors and Capability Declarations** We intentionally excluded a
feature from this specification that we are eager to explore in future versions.
This pertains to defining the capabilities or services associated with the
profile data. By outlining the functions embodied by the profile, this section
provides clarity on the profile's purpose and its role within the DID ecosystem.
